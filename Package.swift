import PackageDescription

// PUBLIC binary distribution of the Colada iOS SDK (Core Module).
//
// This package contains NO source code. It points at the compiled `Colada.xcframework`
// published as a GitHub Release on this public repository. The Swift source lives in the
// private `colada-sdk-ios` repository and is never exposed here.
//
// The `url` and `checksum` below are rewritten automatically by the private repo's release
// workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml) on every version tag. Before the first release
// is published they are placeholders and resolution will fail — that is expected.
